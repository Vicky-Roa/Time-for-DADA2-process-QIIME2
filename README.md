# Time-for-DADA2-process-QIIME2
A few days ago I started with DADA2, it has been running for more than 90 hrs and doesn't finish yet.  I have 56 samples and the input file of DADA2 has 11.1G,  do you think that by the gigabytes and number of samples it will takes more days? Iâ€™m working on a cluster or server, which has more memory than a local computer.
